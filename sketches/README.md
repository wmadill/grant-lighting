# Sketches for grant lighting project

The sketches are in several directories:
* tests - sketches to try out alternative implementations
* utils - sketches used to configure the hardware 
* BlinkM control - control BlinkMs on one bench and coordinate across
multiple benches

Details for each sketch are in the comments at the top of each.
